# Palindromes

A palindrome is a word or phrase which looks the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

The program asks the user for some text then checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.

Notes:
- an empty string isn't a palindrome;
- treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
- spaces are not taken into account during the check - they are treated as non-existent;
